# kafka_stock_market
A stock market simulation pipeline using Kafka and Python, where real-time market data is generated and streamed. The data is stored in S3, processed with AWS Glue Crawler for schema inference, and then queried using Amazon Athena for analysis and insights. This project showcases end-to-end data engineering practices for real-time financial data processing.
